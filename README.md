# complex-transformer

An approach to transformer architecture using complex numbers for more natural representation of rotations, positional encoding, and Fourier-like operations in deep learning.

complex numbers show up in 'fourier stuff', RoPE, and rotations. Layernorm has nice interpretation as projecting onto unit hypersphere.
